## What is Fences?

**Fences** is a revolutionary desktop organization tool that automatically groups your icons into resizable shaded areas, helping you maintain a clean and organized workspace. Unlike traditional desktop management methods that leave icons scattered randomly, Fences creates logical containers that make it easy to categorize and access your applications, files, and folders. This intelligent software learns from your usage patterns and can automatically sort icons into appropriate groups, saving you time and reducing desktop clutter.

The software operates by creating customizable "fences" ‚Äì shaded regions on your desktop that act as containers for specific types of content. These fences can be easily moved, resized, and customized to match your workflow preferences. What sets Fences apart is its ability to automatically organize icons based on file type, usage frequency, or custom rules you define. This means your desktop can maintain organization even as you add new files and applications.

Fences also introduces innovative features like double-click desktop hiding, which allows you to temporarily hide all icons for a clean viewing experience, and automatic organization rules that keep your desktop sorted without manual intervention. The software integrates seamlessly with Windows, maintaining full compatibility with all desktop features while enhancing your productivity.

For users who work with multiple projects or have specific organizational needs, Fences offers advanced customization options including custom fence types, color coding, and layout templates. Whether you're a professional managing multiple work projects, a student organizing academic materials, or a casual user looking to reduce desktop clutter, Fences provides a flexible and intuitive solution that adapts to your needs.
